Method	Description
public User ValidatePassword(String name, String password, String confirmationPassword)	This method should get the User details, create the User object using those details, and return that object.
If the password and confirm password are different then throw a user-defined exception as "PasswordMismatchException" with the message "Password entered does not match".
Note:

If the password matches (case-sensitive) exactly with confirmPassword this method should return User Object.

If the password does not match (case-sensitive) with confirmPassword this method should throw a "PasswordMismatchException".

The Exception object itself should display this message.

To do this, a class PasswordMismatchException inherits the Exception class.

In the Program class, write the Main method and test the method ValidatePassword.

If it returns a valid User object, then display "Registered Successfully".

Use a catch block to handle the exception that is returned by the method PasswordMismatchException. In the catch block display the Exception message.
